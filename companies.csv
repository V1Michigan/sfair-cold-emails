PCH founded Highway1, the world-renown hardware accelerator that helps startups bring innovative products to market. “PCH” stands for “Pacific Coast Highway” because founder Liam Casey loved the early time he spent in Southern California and the positive spirit that the iconic stretch of Highway 1 evoked. PCH is an equal opportunity employer who values diversity and inclusion. PCH is a great place to develop your career and have fun – all while working with great brands and doing rewarding, creative work. We value teamwork, integrity, and passion.
